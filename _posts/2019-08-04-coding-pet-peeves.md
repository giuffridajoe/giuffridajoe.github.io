  <h1>Coding Pet Peeves</h1> 
</div>


## Where to Begin
We all have them. Those things we need to deal with during our travels through daily development work. Those things that hit us deep in the core of our very being. Those fustrating things that sometimes make our lives harder. Ok, I'm being a bit dramatic. But seriously, we all have a list of coding pet peeves. Here's mine, topped off with some venting.

bad variable names
doing too much in a stream
not enough logging
bad comments
not updating comments as development goes along
no unit tests
