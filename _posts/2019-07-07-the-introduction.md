  <h1>The Introduction</h1> 
</div><!-- /.blurb -->

Now that we've been introduced, let me tell you more about myself and what this blog will be about. My daughter is almost 3 years old and she's shaping up to be quite the little person. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and she is a kindergarten teacher. 

I'm into all types of technology including smart home devices, Apple, Raspberry Pi, and home theater to name a few. I never got into gaming that much, mostly because I have terrible hand-eye coordination. I'm also into movies, fantasy football, poker, and podcasts.

As mentioned in my first post, this is my first blog. I think it will be fun to include a movie quote or two in each of my posts one way or another. This one seems relevant at the moment: 

> "Why don't we just wait here for a little while... see what happens..." (The Thing)

I will mainly be writing for self-improvement and satisfaction. I'll be learning as I go. 

> "So long... partner." (Toy Story)
