My first blog and my first blog post. "To Infinity and Beyond!" (We're trying to get our daughter into Toy Story ahead of the Toy Story 4 release. Out in theaters this summer!)

__Update:__ We saw Toy Story 4 and I liked it! I was especially pleased with the ending because it caught me by surprise. Check it out!
