### __Moniker Origin__
This is a nickname of mine that came from a childhood friend many years ago (the name, not the friend). It wasn't an appropriate name to choose for a particular situation, but it stuck with me nonetheless. Anyway, TV technology is something I have always been fascinated with. Being pretty much the only technically savvy person in my group of friends and family made me the go-to for all things technical in nature. Enter the television...

### __The Situation__
Back then, the HDMI spec had just been released and TVs started shipping with the new interface type. Before it, the component type was the state of the art. Before that, composite cables were used. You know - the red, white and yellow cables representing the left and right analog audio plus video, respectively. Component cables split up the one wire containing the video signal into multiple wires according to the primary signals that represent all color video: red, green and blue. The reason for this was to reduce the interference of all that electrically charged copper wire being so close together. 

Ironically, HDMI regressed a bit in terms of the number of physical cables used and went back to one cable. But, this cable was different - it was digital! ~~That meant there is no interference like with analog cables and could, therefore, be stuffed into one cable.~~ The technology had progresed such that certain advancements reduced/eliminated the interference from the cables of old. Thus enabling the reduction in cable count, **plus** it put an end to the need for separate audio cables too. So, going back to one cable was for the best.

### __Advanced Technology, Complex Resolution?__
One day while at my friend's house (I was there all the time), his dad was having some trouble with his newfangled TV and couldn't get any signal from the HDMI input. My friend facetiously stated I might be able to help. What do you think I did? I pulled out the HDMI cable, then... I... plugged it back in. Yup, that's all that was needed. From that point on, I became known as:

### __Present Day__
This friend contacted me a week or two ago for - you guess it - TV advice. He's in the market for a new one and rightfully sought my advice. I like to keep myself up to date with this stuff even though I am not in the market (I have a LG OLEDC6). He had some strict requirements for his purchase (in order of importance):

1. Screen size of 70-75in<br>
2. Low input lag for gaming<br>
3. Above average HDR performance<br>
4. Under $2000

There arent that many solid choices in the category defined above. Most often TV's that large cost more than that. But long story short, his new Vizio P Series Quantum was delivered today.
